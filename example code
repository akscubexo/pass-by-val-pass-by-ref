// a now points to diff obj , while b still points to original obj
console.log(a);  //o/p: anie
console.log(b);  //o/p: avni

//if u want b val to chng u need to reassign  b
//because the reassignment a = {name: 'anie'} does not affect the reference held by b

//obj - js creates it fro scratch
//val- already exists in memory
